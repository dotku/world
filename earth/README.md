# Earth

Of course we want to protect the earth, our home, our place and lives.
But how?!

There are just too much thing we need think about. Recently, I attended
a business course called "Manage Money like a Rich Group" 《像高淨值人群一樣管錢》.
What suprice me is that, the course instructor mentioned how rich people 
thinking about finance management. Their finance plan is quite visionary. 
They are not just think of recent couple years (1 or 3~5 years), but also
30/50/100 years. I can't even think of how that could be in 30 years.

I might have less reading... I should keep it up.

Best,
