# Bangladesh

I heard of this country quite while's ago in China. With Chinese "孟加拉" (Meng Jia La), 
I didn't aware of that word is actually start with "B". It should be "邦加拉" would sound
a better tranlsation.

In 2010, when I was working at Xero, I got acquainted a Bangladesh collegue who is super
nice and frendly. Kinda miss the team.

Today, I found another developer who's name is "Mohammad Faisal" shared serveral good posts.
Here is his [personal website](https://www.mohammadfaisal.dev).
